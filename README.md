## About
Plants vs. Zombies is a tower defense and strategy video game where the player has to defend their house from zombies. The player places different types of plants and fungi on the field, generally stylized as a lawn, to defend their house against the zombies.The playing field is divided into a grid of five or six horizontal rows and nine columns.Each plant has a different style of defense,such as shooting or exploding.Zombies also have their own gimmick, with certain plants being stronger at conquering each one.The player can only pick a limited amount of plants during each level, and each plant costs what is known as **sun** to place. Sun is collected by either clicking on ones that randomly generate over the lawn, or that is generated by certain plants, like **Sunflowers**, Twin Sunflowers, and Sunshrooms. If zombies reach the right edge of the lane, they can be mowed down by **a lawnmower** at the end of each row, clearing all zombies in its path. If the zombie reaches the end of the lane and the lawnmower has already been used, the player has to start the level over.
